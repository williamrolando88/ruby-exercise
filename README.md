# TDD Exercise

> A project exercise where we implement the methodology of Test-Driven-Development(TDD)
in order to create a class called `Solver` that contains three methods:
- factorial
- reverse
- fizzbuzz

Factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number. 
The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that 
the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer 
is given it should raise an exception.

Reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is "hello" 
it returns "olleh").

Fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed 
following these rules:

    - When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
    - When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
    - When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
    - Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
